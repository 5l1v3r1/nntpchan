NNTPChan
========

**NNTPChan** (previously known as overchan) is a decentralized imageboard that uses the NNTP protocol (network-news protocol) to synchronize content between many different servers. It utilizes cryptographically signed posts to perform optional/opt-in decentralized moderation.

This repository contains resources used by the core daemon which is located on [github](https://github.com/majestrate/srndv2) (for now) along with general documentation, [here](doc/)

##Getting started

Before you can begin configuring your NNTPChan node you will have to compile the source code. For instructions read the [Building NNTPChan](doc/build.md) document.
[see build documentation]()
